# HW 11
HW 11 is a demonstration of the central limit theorem. The central limit theorem states that "if you have a population with mean μ and standard deviation σ and take sufficiently large random samples from the population with replacement , then the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed."[1](https://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/mph-modules/bs/bs704_probability/BS704_Probability12.html).

HW11.py demonstrates this by sampling from an exponential distribution with lambda = 0.5 but over several iterations. For each iteration the number of measurements sampled increases by approximately a factor of 2. These measurements are plotted as a histogram. A normal distribution with the same mean and variance as the exponential distribution is plotted on top of the histogram to give an approximation of the distribution.
